            To practice some of our HTML and CSS skills we are going to create a blog webpage. 
            Feel free to alter the theme of your blog, but for the sake of the example we are going to build a dog 
            blog complete with pictures and descriptions of our favorite pups. Typically, when designing a webpage from
             scratch we scaffold the raw HTML first, then we utilize CSS to make it look nice. Follow the challenges/directions 
             below to complete your web page, but keep in mind you will have to research some code to complete the challenges.
              Yay for documentation!!!

              – Challenge 1 –
                • Remove the current "HTML and CSS Challenges" h1 tag (below). Moving forward, place all code inside 
                the body tags.
                • Let’s create a simple header for our webpage. First, create a header tag. 
                 DON'T CONFUSE A header TAG WITH A head tag or an h1-h6 tag. This is a new tag we havn't talked about yet. 
                 It's probably a good idea to look up the documentation on this: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_header.asp. 
                 Then let's nest an h1 tag inside of our header tag. The h1 tag should have the text "Dog Blog" inside of it. Additionally, let's add an id of "heading" to our h1 tag so that we can style our h1 later.
                • Let's also add a Horizontal Rule line after our header to give us some separation. Try looking here for some documentation 
                on Horizontal Rule HTML elements: https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_hr.asp.

                – Challenge 2 –
                Next, let’s start creating our blog posts for our pups.
                • Let’s start by creating a container div for our first blog post and give it class of "blogPost". We will use this class later to style our div.
                Each blog post we create will consist of an image and a description of a dog.
                • Let’s nest an image tag for our first dog post inside our container div and set the src attribute of it equal to a url of a dog we are blogging about (ex. "https://goo.gl/4zBMtT"). 
                You can obtain a url of your own by simply googling an image you want, right clicking it and copying the image address.
                • Next let’s create our description for our dog. 
                Let’s nest an additional div inside of our container div and give it a class of "textContainer". 
                Inside of that textContainer div let's add a paragraph tag. We can add our text that describes our dog. You can come up with this text yourself or you can copy some place holder doggo lorem ipsum here: "https://doggoipsum.com/".
                • Create 4 more of these dog posts to give our page a little more content.
